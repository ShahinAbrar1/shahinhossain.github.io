# About Professor Shahin Hossain

My research centers on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Education, and Public Policy, with a focus on fostering computational literacy and AI fluency across both K-12 and higher education settings. I am committed to advancing educational equity by designing AI-driven frameworks that support diverse student populations.

A key element of my work is collaborating with parents, families, teachers, and communities to create inclusive pathways for young learners. By leveraging AI-based educational interventions, I aim to empower students and address barriers in educational access and opportunity.

I am particularly interested in embedding AI literacy within teacher education programs, equipping educators to effectively integrate AI-powered tools to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. Additionally, I explore how AI can enrich family involvement in childrenâ€™s language and literacy development, fostering more connected, supportive educational environments.

Through this research, I aspire to contribute to future-ready educational systems that utilize AI responsibly, ensuring that all students have equitable access to computational literacy and the skills essential for thriving in an AI-enhanced world.
